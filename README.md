# NotesLib

NotesLib is a library of Python classes for manipulating (Lotus/IBM/HCL)
Notes/Domino objects via COM.

NotesLib was created by Robert Follek, and the current maintainer is Marcelo Huerta.

*(Please don't ask Robert about NotesLib, though: he released the code in text form some
time ago, he doesn't work with Notes any more and the whole idea of updating the code 
and uploading it to PyPI can only be blamed on Marcelo. Who is not working actively with
Notes at this time, so... responses can be slow.)*

NotesLib **depends on a proper installation and configuration of a Notes client on a 
Windows computer**, as it interacts with the COM server that is part of a Notes installation
for Windows and it expects a complete local configuration in place.

The Python version to be installed should be 32- or 64-bits depending on the version of 
the underlying COM server providing the objects accessed by the library. This means that for
a Notes client up to version 11.x, you should install a 32-bit Python. Version 12.x is the first
of the Notes clients to be 64-bit, so the COM server is also, and you need a 64-bit Python to
interact with it.

-----

**We've received information that the COM server in version 12.0 and 12.0.1 had bugs and HCL
solved the specific problems found in version 12.0.2.** *Caveat emptor*: any underlying problems
with the COM server are beyond the scope of this library.

The NotesLib classes correspond to the standard LotusScript classes; they
support all the standard properties and methods. The NotesLib classes have
additional methods and ease-of-use features. See below the details for the
individual classes.

Classes available so far:

-   Session
-   Database
-   ACL
-   ACLEntry

## Session

The Session class creates an COM connection to Notes. It supports all
the properties and methods of the LotusScript NotesSession class, using
the same syntax.

To create a Session object:

    s = noteslib.Session(password)

or

    s = noteslib.Session()

The password is optional; if you don't provide it, Notes will prompt you
for a password.

Example:

    >>> import noteslib
    >>> s = noteslib.Session("password")
    >>> s.NotesBuildVersion
    166
    >>> s.GetEnvironmentString("Directory", -1)
    'd:\\notes5.8\\Data'
    >>>

Session is a singleton - multiple Session variables share one Session
object. You can instantiate Sessions as needed without a performance
penalty, and you only have to establish a password once. Example:

    >>> a = noteslib.Session(password)
    >>> id(a)
    8429868
    >>> b = noteslib.Session()
    >>> id(b)
    8429868

## Database

The Database class creates an COM connection to a Notes database. It
supports all the properties and methods of the LotusScript NotesDatabase
class, using the same syntax.

You don't have to create a Session first. A Database object creates its own
Session automatically.

To create a Database object:

    db = noteslib.Database(server, database_file, password)

or

    db = noteslib.Database(server, database_file)

Example:

    >>> import noteslib
    >>> db = noteslib.Database("NYNotes1", "ACLTest.nsf", "password")
    >>> db.Created
    pywintypes.datetime(2001, 6, 30, 11, 12, 40, tzinfo=TimeZoneInfo('GMT Standard Time', True))

Multiple Database objects created for the same database are unique objects,
but they share the same handle to the underlying NotesDatabase object.
You can instantiate Database objects as needed without a performance
penalty. Example:

    >>> a = noteslib.Database("NYNotes1", "ACLTest.nsf", "password")
    >>> id(a)
    15281724
    >>> id(a._Database__handle)
    15286172
    >>> b = noteslib.Database("NYNotes1", "ACLTest.nsf")
    >>> id(b)
    15270044
    >>> id(b._Database__handle)
    15286172

a and b are different objects, but they share the same internal
NotesDatabase object via the \__handle variable.

## ACL

The ACL class encapsulates a Notes database ACL. It supports all the
properties and methods of the LotusScript NotesACL class, using the same
syntax.

Additional features:

* You can print an ACL object. It knows how to format itself reasonably.
* getAllEntries() method - Returns the ACL contents as a list of ACLEntry objects, sorted by Name.

You don't have to create Session or Database objects first. An ACL object
creates its own Session and Database objects automatically.

To create an ACL object:

    acl = noteslib.ACL(server, database_file, password)

or

    acl = noteslib.ACL(server, database_file)

Example:

    >>> import noteslib
    >>> acl = noteslib.ACL("NYNotes1", "ACLTest.nsf", "password")
    >>> for entry in acl.getAllEntries():
    ...     print (entry.getName())
    ...

## ACLEntry

The ACLEntry class encapsulates a Notes database ACL entry. It supports
all the properties and methods of the LotusScript NotesACLEntry class,
using the same syntax.

Additional features:

* You can print an ACLEntry object. It knows how to format itself reasonably.
* getName() method - Returns the entry name.
* getLevel() method - Returns the entry level.
* getRoles() method - Returns a list of entry roles, sorted alphabetically.
* getFlags() method - Returns a list of the ACLEntry flags, translated to strings.

These methods avoid the obvious names, e.g. getName() instead of name(),
to avoid conflict with the existing NotesACLEntry properties.

Normally, you won't create an ACLEntry object directly. Instead, you can
retrieve a list of ACLEntry objects from an ACL object, via its
getAllEntries() method.

Example:

    >>> import noteslib
    >>> acl = noteslib.ACL("NYNotes1", "ACLTest.nsf", "password")
    >>> print (acl.getAllEntries()[3])
